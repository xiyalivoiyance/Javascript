			As a starting point, download and open the starting point file in your text editor and browser (you can also see it live here). You will see an example with a container, which has some child items. By default these display in normal flow so the boxes display one below the other. We will be working with this file for the first part of this lesson, making changes to see how grid behaves.

        <div>To define a grid we use the grid value of the display property. As with Flexbox, this switches on Grid Layout, and all of the direct children of the container become grid items. Add this to the CSS inside your file:</div>
        <div>Unlike flexbox, the items will not immediately look any different. Declaring display: grid gives you a one column grid, so your items will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal flow.
<br><br>
To see something that looks more grid-like, we will need to add some columns to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns here. You can use any length unit, or percentages to create these column tracks.</div>
        <div>We have only specified column tracks so far, and yet rows are being created to hold our content. This is an example of the explicit versus the implicit grid. The explicit grid is the one that you create using grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows. The implicit grid is created when content is placed outside of that grid — such as into our rows. The explicit and implicit grids are analogous to the main and cross flexbox axes.</div>
        <div>By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized, which in general means that they are large enough to fit their content. If you wish to give implicit grid tracks a size you can use the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties. If you add grid-auto-rows with a value of 100px to your CSS, you will see that those created rows are now 100 pixels tall.</div>
        <div>Our 100-pixel tall tracks won’t be very useful if we add content into those tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it would cause an overflow. It might be better to have tracks that are at least 100 pixels tall and can still expand if more content gets into them. A fairly basic fact about the web is that you never really know how tall something is going to be; additional content or larger font sizes can cause problems with designs that attempt to be pixel perfect in every dimension.</div>
        <div>We can combine some of the things we have learned about track listing, repeat notation and minmax() to create a useful pattern. Sometimes it is helpful to be able to ask grid to create as many columns as will fit into the container. We do this by setting the value of grid-template-columns using repeat() notation, but instead of passing in a number, pass in the keyword auto-fill. For the second parameter of the function we use minmax(), with a minimum value equal to the minimum track size that we would like to have, and a maximum of 1fr.</div>
    </div>
